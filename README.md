Restaurant Selection: Users can choose their preferred restaurant from the available options within the selected category.
Menu Exploration: Users can view the menu offered by the selected restaurant, add items to their cart, and customize their order.
Delivery Location: Users can provide their delivery location, and if it is beyond a specified distance, additional charges will apply.
Billing and Receipt: A detailed bill receipt will be generated, including the selected items, total cost, and any applicable taxes or discounts.
Discount Codes: Users can enter a discount code, and if it matches a system discount code, they can avail a 10% discount on their order.
